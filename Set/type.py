========
Core type objects and lightweight value classes for a SET (card game) engine.

Design goals
------------
- Deterministic & training-friendly: explicit RNG seeds; stable, hashable values.
- Safety: frozen dataclasses / Enums; explicit error types; clear invariants.
- Minimal but complete: just the primitivesâ€”no game loop, no I/O.
- Zen mode only (single-player), but leave room for extensions.

Key invariants
--------------
- A 'Set' is any 3 cards where, for each attribute, the values are either all
  the same or all different.
- A fresh 12-card 'Board' produced by the engine must contain >= 1 valid Set
  when the deal policy requires it (default).
- Cards are unique (no duplicates) within a Deck, Board, and Discard.
